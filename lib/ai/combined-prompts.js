    You are a world-class financial modeling expert creating a complete 3-statement integrated financial model for a SaaS DCF case study. Generate BOTH the case scenario AND the comprehensive 3-statement model including Year 0 baseline.
    
    **LLaMA 3.3 OPTIMIZATION FOR FREE TIER:**
    - Generate comprehensive case with complete 3-statement model in one response
    - Apply institutional-grade modeling standards with proper statement interconnections
    - Ensure all calculations flow correctly between P&L, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow

    **Critical Reality Constraints:**
    - Target IRR should be 15-25% (realistic for SaaS growth companies)
    - Revenue growth should start high but moderate over time
    - Gross margins should be 75-85% (typical for SaaS)
    - Operating margins should improve over time but remain realistic
    - Balance sheet must balance every year (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)

    **PART 1: COMPANY SCENARIO**
    Create a compelling SaaS company story with:
    - Company name and description
    - Year 0 baseline metrics (starting point for all statements)
    - Growth assumptions (customer acquisition, churn, ARPU growth, OpEx ratios)
    - Financial parameters (WACC, tax rate, terminal growth)

    **PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE 3-STATEMENT MODEL (Years 0-5)**
    
    **INCOME STATEMENT (P&L):**
    - Revenue buildup (customers Ã— ARPU with growth/churn)
    - Cost of Goods Sold (hosting, support, etc.)
    - Gross Profit and Margin
    - Operating Expenses (Sales & Marketing, R&D, G&A)
    - EBITDA and EBITDA Margin
    - Depreciation & Amortization
    - EBIT (Operating Income)
    - Interest Expense (on debt)
    - Pre-tax Income
    - Income Tax Expense
    - Net Income

    **BALANCE SHEET:**
    - **Assets:** Cash, Accounts Receivable, PP&E (net), Intangible Assets, Total Assets
    - **Liabilities:** Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, Debt (short/long-term), Total Liabilities
    - **Equity:** Retained Earnings, Additional Paid-in Capital, Total Equity
    - **MUST BALANCE:** Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity

    **CASH FLOW STATEMENT:**
    - **Operating Activities:** Net Income, Depreciation, Working Capital Changes, Operating Cash Flow
    - **Investing Activities:** CapEx, Asset Purchases, Investing Cash Flow
    - **Financing Activities:** Debt Issuance/Repayment, Equity Transactions, Financing Cash Flow
    - **Net Change in Cash:** Sum of all activities
    - **Ending Cash Balance:** Beginning Cash + Net Change

    **STATEMENT INTERCONNECTIONS:**
    - Net Income flows from P&L to Balance Sheet (Retained Earnings) and Cash Flow
    - Depreciation reduces PP&E on Balance Sheet and is added back in Cash Flow
    - Working Capital changes calculated from Balance Sheet changes
    - Cash on Balance Sheet equals ending cash from Cash Flow Statement
    - Interest Expense on P&L calculated from average debt balance on Balance Sheet

    **DCF VALUATION:**
    - Free Cash Flow calculations from the 3 statements
    - WACC discount factors for each year
    - Terminal Value calculation
    - Present Value of cash flows and terminal value
    - Enterprise Value and Equity Value

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
    1. Include Year 0 as baseline for all three statements
    2. All statements must interconnect properly
    3. Balance Sheet must balance every year
    4. Include Excel-like formulas showing methodology
    5. Working Capital = AR + Other Current Assets - AP - Accrued Liabilities
    6. Free Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation - CapEx - Change in Working Capital
